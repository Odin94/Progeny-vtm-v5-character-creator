# Step 1 – Detect SDKs

**Read ONLY this file.** Do not read any other reference file until this one tells you to.

Seed the audit checklist, then find every PostHog SDK in the project and remember which language(s) and framework(s) the rest of the audit will work on. **Read-only on the codebase.** Don't scan code for capture sites – that's step 2.

## Tools

Load via `ToolSearch select:Read,Glob,mcp__wizard-tools__audit_seed_checks,mcp__wizard-tools__audit_resolve_checks` once at the start of this step. Subsequent steps reuse `audit_resolve_checks` to advance the phase, so it stays loaded.

## Status

Emit, in order:

```
[STATUS] Seeding audit checklist
[STATUS] Detecting SDKs
```

## Action

### a. Seed the audit checklist

The checklist lives at `.posthog-audit-checks.json` and renders live in the wizard sidebar / "Audit plan" tab. **Don't rely on the runtime pre-seeding it** — call `mcp__wizard-tools__audit_seed_checks` directly here. The tool replaces the file atomically, so calling it once at the start of every run is safe.

Seed all seven pipeline phases. The wizard already pre-seeds the same shape so the sidebar boots populated; seeding again is idempotent and guarantees you own the exact labels later steps resolve against.

```json
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "id": "detect-sdk",
      "area": "Detect SDK",
      "label": "Identify PostHog SDK(s) in dependencies",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": "scan-sites",
      "area": "Scan capture sites",
      "label": "Grep capture/identify/group call sites",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": "enrich-sites",
      "area": "Enrich",
      "label": "Subagent fan-out to read capture files",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": "query-volume",
      "area": "Query PostHog",
      "label": "30-day volume + last_seen via MCP",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": "write-report",
      "area": "Write report",
      "label": "Render posthog-events-audit-report.md",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": "create-dashboard",
      "area": "Create dashboard",
      "label": "Build insights of findings",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": "upload-notebook",
      "area": "Upload notebook",
      "label": "Write the markdown report into a PostHog notebook",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

Don't invent new ids — later steps resolve their own phase by these exact ids. Don't `Write` the file directly; the MCP tool owns it.

### b. Find PostHog SDKs

`Glob` for the project's dependency manifests across every language PostHog ships an SDK for. The full list:

- `package.json` - npm / pnpm / yarn (Node, web, React, Next.js, Nuxt, Vue, Svelte, Angular, React Native, Expo)
- `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile`, `setup.py` – Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- `Gemfile` - Ruby / Rails
- `composer.json` - PHP / Laravel
- `go.mod` - Go
- `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`, `pom.xml` – Java / Android
- `Podfile`, `Package.swift` – iOS / Swift
- `pubspec.yaml` - Flutter / Dart
- `*.csproj` - .NET
- `mix.exs` - Elixir

Read enough of them to identify which PostHog SDK the project uses, what version, and what framework it sits on top of.

If the project is a monorepo, you may find multiple PostHog SDKs.

If no PostHog SDK is anywhere in the project, emit `[ABORT] No PostHog SDK found` and stop. The wizard catches `[ABORT]` and terminates the run.

For each dependency manifest, extract every dependency whose name starts with `posthog` (e.g. `posthog`, `posthog-node`, `posthog-js`, `posthog-python`, `posthog-ruby`). Hold `{ sdk, version, manifest, framework }` per SDK in memory. The next step uses this list.

If no PostHog SDK is anywhere, emit `[ABORT] No PostHog SDK found`.

### c. Resolve the phase

Once the SDK list is in memory, call `mcp__wizard-tools__audit_resolve_checks` to flip the `detect-sdk` row to `pass`:

```json
{
  "updates": [
    { "id": "detect-sdk", "status": "pass" }
  ]
}
```

This advances the wizard sidebar to the next phase ("Scan capture sites"). Continue to step 2.
