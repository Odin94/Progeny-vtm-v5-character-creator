## Character Sheet TODOs

* XP-spend-mode (show available XP at mouse, float out spent xp numbers, show cost on hover), free-edit-mode, play-mode
* Notes popup with big text editor
* Dice-roller popup
* Links from creator to sheet and vice versa
* More bg images?
* Add more Disciplines
* Make performance less terrible when editing character sheet

### Disciplines
* Add more powers
* Add thinblood alchemy
* Add buying Rituals
* Dice-pool hover should include eg. Prowess for strength
* Give "+" buttons a cute animation on hover

### Merits/Flaws
* Add more Merits/Flaws
* Allow upgrading (if you have resources 1, you should be able to upgrade to 2,3,4...)
* Make merit cards even height maybe?
* Long-term: Analyse your metrics and allow users to show only popular merit/flaw options?
